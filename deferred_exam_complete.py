#
# You have 2.5 hours to work on the exam, and 30 minutes to submit it. You may
# keep writing the exam during the submission window, but it is your
# responsibility to make sure that the exam is submitted before the submission
# window closes.

# All questions below have been answered by Ibrahim Hassan on 22 Jan. 2022

# Problem 1 (25 pts)
#    Assume you are given a list of file names of text files. Assume
#    that the text files only contain the punctuation
#    [".", ",", "!", "?", "-"].
#    The files may also contain the newline character "\n".
#    Assume all the text in the files is lower-case.
#
#    For each pair of words, we could compute the number of files in which
#    they co-occur.
#
#    For example, if the input files are ["f1.txt", "f2.txt", "f3.txt"], and
#    "dog" occurs in f1.txt and f3.txt, and "cat" occurs in f1.txt, f2.txt,
#    and f3.txt, we'll say that "cat" and "dog" co-occur in the input
#    files 2 times.
#
#    Write a function that finds the pair of words that co-occur in files
#    most often. Return the pair of words as an alphabetically-sorted list.

# Problem 2 (20 pts)
#
#  In this problem, you will be writing a function that processes a string
#  of lower-case English characters (and no other characters apart from spaces).
#
#  Words that do not denote digits ("one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six",
#  "seven", "eight", "nine", and "zero") should be unaltered. Words that
#  denote digits that do not occur next to other words that denote digits
#  should also be unaltered. Sequences of digit words that occur together
#  should be transformed into digits, without separating spaces.
#
# For example,
#   transform_digits("three people took a class in the year two zero two one. and one other.")
# should return
# "three people took a class in the year 2021. and one other."

# Problem 4 (10 pts)

# Problem 5 (10 pts)
#
# We can use a dictionary to record who is friends with whom by recording the lists of friends in a dictionary.
#For example:
# friends = {"Carl Gauss": ["Isaac Newton",  "Charles Babbage"],
#            "Charles Babbage": ["Isaac Newton", "Carl Gauss", "Ada Lovelace"],
#            "Ada Lovelace": ["Michael Faraday", "Charles Babbage"],
#            "Isaac Newton": ["Charles Babbage"],
#            "Michael Faraday"" ["Ada Lovelace"] }
# Here, Carl Gauss is friends with Isaac Newton, Gottfried Leibniz, and Charles Babbage. Assume that
# friendships are symmetric, so that if X is friends with Y, then itâ€™s guaranteed that Y is friends with X.
#
# Write a program that finds the pair of people the "friendship path" between whom is the longest. For example,
# the path between Carl Gauss and Michael Faraday is of length 4 (Carl Gauss->Charles Babbage->Ada Lovelace->Michael Faraday),
# and is the longest in friends


# The code below is not complete, but does not show any errors when run
# which is why I did not comment it out

"Charles Babbage": ["Isaac Newton", "Carl Gauss", "Ada Lovelace"],
"Ada Lovelace": ["Michael Faraday", "Charles Babbage"],
